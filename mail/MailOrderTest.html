<H1>A Sample Mail Order Applet
</H1>
Enter the information requested. Select each item that you wish to order from the menu, enter how many of them that you wish to order, and click on "Add". Click on "Done" to compute sales tax and
shipping charges. (The computation is not actually implemented.) Click on
"Send" to mail in your order.

Obviously this applet needs quite a bit of work to be useful. But it shows
the basic information flow, how to get pricing information from a file on the server
and how to mail in the order using an CGI script.
